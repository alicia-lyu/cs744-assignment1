# Part 3 Task 4

See the report for code changes.

The code is located in

- `/part3/main_big.py` and `/part3/task_big.py` for starting the application with a big dataset enwiki-pages-articles
- `/part3/main.py` and `/part3/task.py` for starting the application with a small dataset web-BerkStan.txt
- `/part3/tools.py` for the main functions of the application

All files are shared across tasks, with conditional statements to execute task-specific code.

How to run the application: 

- Simply run `./run.sh` from the current directory (`/part3/task4/`). But make sure the repo is located in `/mnt/data/cs744-assignment1`.
- Alternatively, you can run `./run.sh` or `make run` from `/part3` to start 4 tasks all-together in order.
